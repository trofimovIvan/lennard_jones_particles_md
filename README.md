This repository contains algorithms and files used for the implementation of molecular dynamic calculations.

A system of particles, interacting particles according to the Lennard-Jones potential was modeled. The following characteristics of the system looked like:
  1) energy conservation. Rather, its fluctuation
  2) The output of the coordinate discrepancy to the diffusion mode (according to the Einstein equation)
  3) Velocity distribution according to Maxwell distribution
  4) Visualization of the system using OVITO.
      Format files were output for visualization .xyz
  5) using periodic boundary conditions

The work was done by Ivan Trofimov in the 2020-21 academic year. MIPT.
